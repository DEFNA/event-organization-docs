# Interviews

DEFNA interviews is a collaborative effort to gather information from people
who have been involved in organizing Django events. These interviews are aimed
at helping other community members who would like to organize events and would
like to hear stories about how to do this.

Here we will document questions and guidelines to follow when conducting these
interviews. Hopefully, this will help current and future DEFNA Board members
as well as anybody else who's looking for ideas on how to conduct interviews.

## Before the interview

    - Which event have you been (or are) involved in?
    - Tell us about your hobbies.
    - What do you do for a living?
